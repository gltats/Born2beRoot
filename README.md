‚ö†Ô∏è ADVICE: ```Before we move onto starting your Virtual Machine, make sure you remember your Host, Username and Password/s.```

Part 1.3 - Starting Your Virtual Machine
- Press enter on Debian GNU/Linux
- Enter your encryption password you had created before
- Login in as the your_username you had created before
- Type ```lsblk``` in your Virtual Machine to see the partition

## Part 2: Installing necesary tools
Part 2.1 - Installing Sudo
- First type ```su -``` to login in as the root user.
- Then type ```apt-get update -y```
- Then type ```apt-get upgrade -y```
- Then type ```apt install sudo```
- Then type ```usermod -aG sudo your_username``` to add user in the sudo group (To check if user is in sudo group, type getent group sudo)
- Type ```sudo visudo`` to open sudoers file
- Lastly find ```# User privilege specification```, type ```your_username  	ALL=(ALL) ALL```

Part 2.2 - Installing Git and Vim
- Then type ```apt-get install git -y``` to install Git
- Then type ```git --version``` to check the Git Version
- Then type ```apt install vim``` to install Vim
- Then type ```vim --version``` to check the Git Version

## Part 3: SSH and UWF
Part 3.1 - Installing and Configuring SSH (Secure Shell Host)
- Type ```sudo apt install openssh-server```
- Type ```sudo systemctl status ssh``` to check SSH Server Status
- Type ```sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config```
- Find this line ```#Port22```
- Change the line to ```Port 4242``` without the # (Hash) in front of it
- Exit and save
- Then type ```sudo grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config``` to check if the port settings are right
- Lastly type ```sudo service ssh restart``` to restart the SSH Service

Part 3.2 - Installing and Configuring UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
First type apt-get install ufw to install UFW
Type ```sudo ufw enable``` to inable UFW
Type ```sudo ufw status numbered``` to check the status of UFW
Type sudo ```ufw allow ssh``` to configure the Rules
Type sudo ```ufw allow 4242``` to configure the Port Rules
Lastly Type ```sudo ufw status numbered``` to check the status of UFW 4242 Port

Part 3.3 Connecting to SSH
To exit your Virtual Machine and use your mouse, press command and click left and your mouse should appear
Go to your Virtual Box Program
Click on your Virtual Machine and select Settings
Click Network then Adapter 1 then Advanced and then click on Port Forwarding
Add or edit the rule 1, and set the ```Host Port``` and ```Guest Port``` to ```4242```(double check this step)
Then head back to your Virtual Machine
Type ```sudo systemctl restart ssh``` to restart your SSH Server
Type ```sudo service sshd status``` to check your SSH Status
Open an iTerm and type the following ```ssh your_username@127.0.0.1 -p 4242```
To quit your SSH iTerm Connection type ```exit```. Its possible and would say easier to continue doing this project on iTerm.

## Part 4: Password
- First type ```sudo apt-get install libpam-pwquality``` to install Password Quality Checking Library
- Then type ``sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password`` (You can also use vim)
- Find this line. ```password		requisite```
- Add this to the end of that line `minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root`
- The line should now look like this ``- password  requisite     pam_pwquality.so  retry=3 minlen=10 ucredit=-1 dcredit=-1 maxrepeat=3 reject_username difok=7 enforce_for_root``
- Save and Exit
- Next type in your Virtual Machine ```sudo vim /etc/login.defs```
- Find this part ``PASS_MAX_DAYS 9999 PASS_MIN_DAYS 0 PASS_WARN_AGE 7``
- Change that part to ``PASS_MAX_DAYS 30`` and ``PASS_MIN_DAYS 2`` keep ``PASS_WARN_AGE 7`` as the same
- Lastly type ``sudo reboot`` to reboot the change affects


## Part 6: Creating a Group
- First type ```sudo groupadd user42 ```to create a group

- Type ```sudo adduser new_username``` to create a username - write down your new_username, as you will need this later on.
- Type ```sudo usermod -aG user42 your_username``` to add the user to this group, do the same with same evaluating group.
- Type ``getent group user42`` to check if the user is the group, do the same with same evaluating group.
- Type ``groups`` to see which groups the user account belongs to
- Lastly ``type chage -l your_new_username`` to check if the password rules are working in users

## Part 7: Creating sudo.log
- First type ``cd ~/../``
- Then type ``cd var/log``
- Then type ``mkdir sudo ``(if it already exists, then continue to the next step).
- Then type ``cd sudo && touch sudo.log``
- Then type ``cd ~/../``

Part 7.1 - Configuring Sudoers Group
- First type ```sudo nano /etc/sudoers``` to go the sudoers file
- Now edit your sudoers file to look like the following by adding in all of the defaults:
  ``` - Defaults	env_reset
   - Defaults	mail_badpass
   - Defaults	secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
   - Defaults	badpass_message="Password is wrong, please try again!"
   - Defaults	passwd_tries=3
   - Defaults	logfile="/var/log/sudo.log"
   - Defaults	log_input, log_output
   - Defaults	requiretty```
   -

                                           #         Evaluation Q&A         #

- What is virtual machine?
--> A‚ÄØVirtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy 
apps. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all
running on the same host. For example, you can run a virtual MacOS machine on a physical PC. 

- What it's purpose?
--> VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different
operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment. 

- How does it works?
--> VM working through "Virtualization" technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows 
VMs to run on a single host machine.

- Diff between aptitude and apt?
--> Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower-level package manager which can be used by other 
higher-level package managers
(read more: https://www.tecmint.com/difference-between-apt-and-aptitude/)

- What is AppArmor?
--> AppArmor ("Application Armor") is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs'
capabilities with per-program profiles.
(read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor)

- What is SSH?
--> SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system 
administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.
(read more: https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Secure-Shell)

- What is SELinux?
--> Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux¬Æ systems that allows administrators to have more control 
over who can access the system. 

- What is UWF?
--> Is a firewall configuration tool that runs on top of iptables , included by default within Ubuntu distributions. It provides a streamlined interface for configuring common firewall use cases via the command line.
